Declaring a newstage of life could help change perceptions. It has done so before. Today’s conception of childhood emerged in the 19th century, paving the way for child-protection laws and a golden age of children’s literature. Spotty, awkward 15-year-olds predated the 1940s, but only then did mystified adults coin the label “teenagers”, fueling all sorts of products and services, from bobby socks to the music industry. In 1944 Life wrote that “American businessmen, many of whom have teenage daughters, have only recently begun to realise that teenagers make up a big and special market.” By the mid-1960s both Time and Newsweek had splashed “The Teen-Agers” on their covers.</span></a></li><li class="nav-item nav-level-6"><a class="nav-link" href="#4-Marking-out-youthful-old-age-as-a-distinct-phase-of-life-might-have-a-similar-effect-prodding-employers-and-policy-makers-to-think-differently-about-how-to-keep-the-young-old-active-As-life-becomes-longer-the-word-%E2%80%9Cretirement%E2%80%9D-which-literally-means-withdrawal-to-a-place-of-seclusion-has-become-misleading-At-65-you-are-not-clapped-out-but-pre-tired-So-as-they-embark-on-the-next-stage-here%E2%80%99s-to-all-those-pre-tirees"><span class="nav-text">4. Marking out youthful old age as a distinct phase of life might have a similar effect, prodding employers and policy-makers to think differently about how to keep the young old active. As life becomes longer, the word “retirement”, which literally means withdrawal to a place of seclusion, has become misleading. At 65 you are not clapped out, but pre-tired. So, as they embark on the next stage, here’s to all those pre-tirees.</span></a></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></div>

<li><strong>翻译</strong><br>  然而，末世论者都往往未能领会更重要的一点：因长寿延长而增加的那些年头中，人们绝大多数时候都是健康的。据华盛顿大学健康计量评估研究所（Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation）估算，与1990年出生的英国男孩相比，一个2015年出生的英国男孩的寿命预计会长六年，其中有五年是健康状态。大多政府和公司都没能认识到这一点，而是潦草地将这多出来的几年与“65岁以上”这个倒霉的年龄组别混为一谈。仿佛临退休就是走到了悬崖边，员工和消费者会猛然跌落—–这样的两分法与现实世界相去甚远。这种想法还会催生缺乏创意的政策，紧随寿命延长偶尔变更退休年龄。</li>

<li><strong>翻译</strong><br>  宣布一个新的人生阶段的存在可以帮助改变人们的认知，从前这种情形就已发生过。我们今天所说的“童年”这一概念就出现于19世纪，它为儿童保护法的出台以及儿童文学黄金年代的出现铺平了道路。脸上满是痘痘，举止笨拙的15岁孩子并不是到了1940年代才有，但直到这个时期，困惑的成年人才创造出“青少年”（teenagers）这个标签。在之后便涌现出各种各样的产品和服务，从翻边短袜到音乐产业不一而足。1944年，《生活》（life）杂志写道，“很多美国商人自己就有十几岁的女儿，却直到最近才开始意识到，青少年构成了一个庞大而特殊的市场。”到了1960年代中期，青少年的形象还大举登上了《时代》和《新闻周刊》的封面。</li>
