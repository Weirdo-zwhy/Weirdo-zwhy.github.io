<li><strong>翻译</strong><br> 文章开始之前先给大家讲一个小故事：1953年，哈佛心理学家B·F斯金纳旁听了他女儿的数学课，他发现，每一个学生都在以同样的方式、同样的进度学习同一个课题。几天之后，他便设计了他的第一个“教学机器”，这个教学机器可以让学生们根据自己的节奏学习。到上世纪60年代中期，这种设备获得大卖。然而没过几年，人们对它的热情逐渐消失。</li>

<li><strong>翻译</strong><br>  第二个伪科学理念是，技术发展意味着儿童不再需要学习知识或向老师学习，Google一下，你就知道。甚至一些教育学者更进一步，他们认为，知识妨碍了创造力和批判性思维等能力的开发。但事实恰恰相反，一个装满知识的大脑才能更好的培养人才。文章以莎士比亚为例，莎士比亚从小就接受拉丁语短语和语法规则的训练，但却也写出了几部优秀的戏剧。2015年，一项包含1200项教育元分析的大型研究发现，最能有效促进学习的20种方法几乎全部依赖老师的教导。</li>

Declaring a newstage of life could help change perceptions. It has done so before. Today’s conception of childhood emerged in the 19th century, paving the way for child-protection laws and a golden age of children’s literature. Spotty, awkward 15-year-olds predated the 1940s, but only then did mystified adults coin the label “teenagers”, fueling all sorts of products and services, from bobby socks to the music industry. In 1944 Life wrote that “American businessmen, many of whom have teenage daughters, have only recently begun to realise that teenagers make up a big and special market.” By the mid-1960s both Time and Newsweek had splashed “The Teen-Agers” on their covers.</h6><blockquote>

<li><strong>翻译</strong><br>  但内燃机的日子所剩不多。电池技术的快速发展对电动汽车更有利。1894年，巴黎没有一辆电动汽车驶出起跑线，部分原因是当时的电动汽车需要每30公里左右就设置一个电池更换站。如今的电动汽车由锂离子电池供电，性能更强。雪佛兰博尔特的续航里程为383公里；特斯拉车迷最近驾驶的一辆Model S在一次充电后行驶了超过1000公里。瑞银（UBS）估计，到明年，拥有一辆电动汽车的总成本将与燃油汽车持平——虽然电动车的制造商仍然会亏钱。瑞银乐观地预测，到2025年，电动汽车将占全球汽车销量的14%，远高于今天的1%。其他机构的预测要更加谨慎，但也急忙上调了预期，因为电池的成本降低、性能提升——每千瓦时的成本已经从2010年的1000美元降至今天的130至200美元。燃油车的监管政策也在收紧。越来越多的国家禁售燃油汽车，上月，英国也颁布相关政策，表示到2050年，所有新车都必须实现零排放。</li>
