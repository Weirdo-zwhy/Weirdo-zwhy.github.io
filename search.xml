<li><strong>翻译</strong><br>  宣布一个新的人生阶段的存在可以帮助改变人们的认知，从前这种情形就已发生过。我们今天所说的“童年”这一概念就出现于19世纪，它为儿童保护法的出台以及儿童文学黄金年代的出现铺平了道路。脸上满是痘痘，举止笨拙的15岁孩子并不是到了1940年代才有，但直到这个时期，困惑的成年人才创造出“青少年”（teenagers）这个标签。在之后便涌现出各种各样的产品和服务，从翻边短袜到音乐产业不一而足。1944年，《生活》（life）杂志写道，“很多美国商人自己就有十几岁的女儿，却直到最近才开始意识到，青少年构成了一个庞大而特殊的市场。”到了1960年代中期，青少年的形象还大举登上了《时代》和《新闻周刊》的封面。</li>

<li><strong>翻译</strong><br>  将状态仍年轻的老年时光划为一个独立的人生阶段也许会产生类似的影响，敦促雇主和政策制定者在思索如何令“老年人”保持活跃时跳脱窠臼。随着人们寿命变长，“退休”这个词（retirement，字面意思指过隐居生活）已变得有误导性。到了65岁的人并非不顶用，而是“预退休”。所以，在这些人开始下一个人生阶段之际，让我们向所有预退休人士致以敬意和祝福吧。</li>
